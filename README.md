In this program, I have implemented the logic of a game called Mancala. The code is written with focus on Changeability. Starting from a basic code, I have added extra features
on a weekly basis and have assessed the changeability aspect of my code. 

This repository also includes my report on Changeability in which I discuss the definition mentioned in class and in other articles.
